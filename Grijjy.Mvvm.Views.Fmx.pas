type
  { A base form that you can use for view in a MVVM model.
    This form takes care of the following:
    * It implements the IgoView interfaces.
    * It provides a default data binder through the Binder property.
    * On desktop platforms, when the form is shown modally (by calling
      ExecuteModal), it "grays out" the previous active form as a visual
      indicator that it is not accessible. You can disable this behaviour by
      setting GrayOutPreviousForm to False.
    * By default, it frees the form when it closes (that is, the CloseAction
      is set to caFree). You can change this by overriding DoClose or
      assigning an OnClose event.

    True modal forms are not supported on the Android platform. So to make the
    experience the same on all platforms, ExecuteModal is non-blocking and just
    shows the form without waiting for it to be closed. It will call the given
    anonymous AResultProc when the form is closed. (Note: unlike the standard
    ShowModal method, AResultProc is also called if the form is closed when
    the user presses the X button; in that case the AModelResult parameter will
    be mrCancel.)

    The type parameter TVM is the type of the view model used by the view. }

      Parameters:
        AViewModel: the view model to associate with the view.
          The view model MUST remain alive for the duration of the view. The
          view does NOT become owner of the view model.
        AOwnsViewModel: whether the view becomes owner of the view model. If
          True, then the view model will automatically be freed when the view is
          freed.

      This method calls the SetupView method, which you should override to setup
      any data bindings. }

      Parameters:
        AResultProc: an anonymous method that will be called when the view
          closes. The parameter to this method is a TModalResult that indicates
          how the view was closed.

      NOTE: unlike the standard ShowModal method, AResultProc is also called if
      the form is closed when the user presses the X icon; in that case the
      AModelResult parameter will be mrCancel. }
